# Automated-Chrome-using-Selenium-Python
This Python script utilizes Selenium WebDriver to automate interactions with Google's search functionality. It navigates to Google's homepage, clicks on the "I'm Feeling Lucky" button, then the "Library" icon, searches for the keyword "Cricket", and finally clicks on the second image related to cricket in the search results.
